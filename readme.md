# Default LinkStack theme but without dark mode
This is an exact clone of the [default LinkStack theme](https://github.com/LinkStackOrg/linkstack-default-theme) with as only change that all dark mode entries in the stylesheet have been replaced with their light mode opponents.

Dark mode was ruining my LinkStack page's styling because of it mismatching with the colors in my custom background. This theme might not be the neatest solution to solve this issue, but hey, it works..
